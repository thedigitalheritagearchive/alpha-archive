			The Retro Computer Museum is a registered charity (Charity registration no. 1146912) dedicated to the benefit of the public for the preservation, display and public experience of computer and console systems from the 1960's onwards.

			Our main focus is on systems that were in use in the home, rather than big computer systems and mainframes of early computer development. We have systems ranging from the 1970s - such as Binatone Pong and of course the amazing Commodore Pet right up to the lovely delights of the late 1990s - with systems such as the Sega Dreamcast. Along with the fantastic and varied machines of the 1980s too we have a huge collection of retro gaming goodness.
